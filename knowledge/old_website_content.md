# About Samuel Morris

Born in Oceanside, California, but hailing from Victoria, BC, Sam moved to Montreal in 2018 to pursue an undergraduate education at McGill University. Shortly thereafter, he discovered the thrill of solving challenging problems and fell in love with computer science. Now in his fourth and final year, Sam looks toward the future with purposeful optimism and excitement, searching for a dynamic, full-time role as a software developer.

Away from the computer, Sam enjoys watching Studio Ghibli movies, playing Chess and Settlers of Catan against his friends, immersing himself in sci-fi novels, regularly losing games of Spikeball, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen.

# Samuel Morris's Small Personal Projects

### Brick Breaker.
Before December 2020, I had no prior experience with JavaScript and wanted to challenge myself to learn the basics by using a fun project as motivation. The result was a simple Brick-Breaker game, complete with music, particle effects, and fifteen unique levels, which can be played here.

One of the reasons this project was challenging is because I wanted to design a variety of levels for the player. To do so properly, I had to find an efficient way to create them all and insert them into the code, and to solve this I created a script that transforms small PNG images into each level. So I could simply open up an image editor and draw my levels instead of hard-coding them into JavaScript.

### Q-Learning Tic-Tac-Toe.
The stardard version of Q-Learning is a simple algorithm, based on reinforcement learning, where an agent simulates many games against itself in order to learn by remembering its past mistakes and victories. In Summer 2020, I created a Tic-Tac-Toe agent (and GUI) in Python using the Q-Learning algorithm, which learned to play perfectly over many iterations.

### Samtago-Twist.
For the final project of my artificial intelligence course in Winter 2021, I programmed a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm for the board game Pentago. The MCTS algorithm is designed to find the best move in games that are very complex, and my version of it performed in the top 25% of my class.

### Portfolio Website.
In February 2022, I decided to revamp my old portfolio website using JavaScript's React framework, which resulted in the website you see here today! Part of my motvation for building this website was because I wanted to learn React, but I was also motivated to build something that was interactive, which is why I added the color-changing aspect to the website's design.

The colors that appear when you refresh the page are generated with The Color API, which I used because I was curious about how to integrate data from HTTP requests into a React application.
